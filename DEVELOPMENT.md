## Setting up the development environment

Once I've got automated testing working I will document the required setup in detail.

There's quite a lot of setup required.

I don't have access to Windows or Mac/OS, so these instructions assume a Linux environment.

1. You'll need to install `Freeplane`. I'm using version 1.7.2; the test setup will need adjusting if you use another 
version
2. For testing, `Freeplane` is invoked with a custom configuration directory.
