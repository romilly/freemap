6. automated testing using [Freeplane Scripting](https://www.freeplane.org/wiki/index.php/Scripting) and [appraise](https://github.com/AppraiseQA/appraise)

The top-level `examples` directory is used by `appraise` for automated testing.

There are two groups of notebooks in the project; `examples` of use, and `spikes` used during exploration and 
development.
