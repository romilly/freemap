2. add, edit or remove branches from a map
3. edit a branch (or root) of an existing map
   1. change text
      1. as text or
      2. as rich text from markdown
   2. add, change or delete
      1. details
      2. notes
   3. change appearance (colour, font colour, background colour)
4. create links

There are two groups of notebooks in the project; `examples` showing how to use freemap, and `spikes` used during 
exploration and development.
