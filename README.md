=======

This project has just (re-)started, and does not yet have useful code.

## Goals

1. automated testing using [xdotool](https://github.com/jordansissel/xdotool) and [appraise](https://github.
com/AppraiseQA/appraise)
2. Create a new freeplane map using an empty map template
3. add, edit or remove branches from a map
4. edit a branch (or root) of an existing map
   1. change text
      1. as text or
      2. as rich text from markdown
   2. add, change or delete
      1. details
      2. notes
   3. change appearance (colour, font colour, background colour)
5. create links
6. create clouds

The top-level `examples` directory is used by `appraise` for automated testing.

There are two groups of notebooks in the project; `examples` showing how to use freemap, and `spikes` used during 
exploration and development.
